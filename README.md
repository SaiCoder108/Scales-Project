# Harmonium Swarams Transposition Tool

A web app that allows users to **select a musical scale and swarams (notes)** and see the corresponding chord **transposed to a chosen scale**, with an interactive piano interface for visualizing the notes.  

---

## Features

- Interactive piano keyboard with **clickable keys** representing swarams.  
- Dropdown to select a **target scale** for transposition.  
- **Dynamic output** showing the transposed chord relative to the selected scale.  
- Styled front end for a **clean, user-friendly visualization**.  

---

## How it Works

- The backend, built with **Python and Flask**, calculates the transposed chord for a given scale.  
- The front end uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to render the piano and display results dynamically.  
- Musical theory formulas are used to map swarams to notes and transpose them accurately.  
- The app **visualizes musical transposition**, allowing users to see how chords shift between scales in real time.

## My Contribution

- Designed the **project structure and interaction flow**.  
- Implemented the **front end visualization**, including the interactive piano and styled output.  
- Integrated the **backend transposition logic** with the front end using Flask routes.  
- Used established musical formulas to ensure **accurate chord transposition**.  

> Note: The front-end structure and integration were assembled using musical theory formulas to render and visualize the transposed notes correctly.
